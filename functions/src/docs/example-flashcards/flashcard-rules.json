      "question": "What is a 'closure' in JavaScript?",
      "answer": "A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between `==` and `===`?",
      "answer": "`==` is the abstract equality operator, which compares two values for equality after attempting to convert them to a common type (type coercion). `===` is the strict equality operator, which checks for equality without type conversion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the `...` spread operator do?",
      "answer": "The spread syntax (...) allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created."
