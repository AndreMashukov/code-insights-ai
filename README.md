- **Command navigation** (Ctrl/Cmd+Up/Down between commands)
- **Directory detection** for enhanced file linking
- **Terminal IntelliSense** with autocomplete
- **Project-aware prompts** showing your current location
- **Nx command shortcuts** (e.g., `nxb` for build, `nxt` for test)
- **Quick navigation** (`cdweb`, `cdfunctions`, `cdlibs`)

See [Shell Integration Setup](./scripts/shell-integration/README.md) for detailed instructions.
