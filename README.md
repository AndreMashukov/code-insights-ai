> **Status:** âœ… Firebase Functions deployment permissions fixed - Testing in progress

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up VS Code Shell Integration (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   npm run setup-shell-integration
   ```
   Or use the Nx command:
   ```bash
   nx run shell-integration:setup
   ```

3. **Start development:**
   ```bash
   nx serve web
   ```

## Development Tools

### VS Code Shell Integration

This workspace includes enhanced VS Code terminal integration that provides:

- **Command decorations** with success/failure indicators
- **Command navigation** (Ctrl/Cmd+Up/Down between commands)
- **Directory detection** for enhanced file linking
- **Terminal IntelliSense** with autocomplete
- **Project-aware prompts** showing your current location
- **Nx command shortcuts** (e.g., `nxb` for build, `nxt` for test)
- **Quick navigation** (`cdweb`, `cdfunctions`, `cdlibs`)

See [Shell Integration Setup](./scripts/shell-integration/README.md) for detailed instructions.

### Available Commands

- `nx serve web` - Start the web development server
